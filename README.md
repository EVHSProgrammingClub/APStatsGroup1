Mr. Johnson's Email:

Here is what I want to do.  I want to simulate collecting a sampling distribution from a known population.  What that means is that we start with a known population, take a random sample of ___ people, find the mean of that sample, and repeat that process a bunch of times.  It's a lot like what we did when we fired 3 people in the Bob Martin vs Westvaco case.  The differences are that the original data is presented in a different way, We won't always use 3, and at the end I would like to make either a dot plot or bar graph of these multiple means.


What we start with is scores from the 2019 AP Stats Exam, and the proportion of students who received those scores nationwide

 
5 - 14.7%

4 - 18.4%

3 - 26.6%

2 - 19.3%

1 - 21%

We would then take a random sample of n people, find the mean, and repeat it a bunch of times, then make a dot plot of those means.

If we were in class we would first learn how to use our calculator to get a random number between 000 and 999.  Numbers 000 - 146 would represent a 5, 147 - 330 a 4, .....  I would then have some of the students take a sample size of 5 people, find the mean score and repeat that process a bunch of times.  A different group would take a sample size of 10 people, and the rest would do sample sizes of 20 people.  The ultimate idea would be to compare the results and look for similarities between 5 people, 10 people and 20 people.  But we would also be able to walk up to the board and make three different dot plots.  

I have had students able to write a program on their calculators or computers which could do this and repeat it WAY faster than those that were doing it by hand. But they only got mean, mean, mean, .... but could not graph those means (or at least I did not need them to do that since we were in class) 

In my dream world I would have a program that I could be showing you guys online.  I could change the sample size (n) from 5 to 10 to 20 or whatever I wanted, and I could change how many times to repeat this - for example 1000 times, 5000 times, and then it would create a dot plot (or a bar graph) right away.
